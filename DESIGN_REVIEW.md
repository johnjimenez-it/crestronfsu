# Crestron Touch Panel UI Review

## Overall Impression
The layout successfully conveys a sophisticated control surface, but the heavy use of deep maroon and black backgrounds combined with small typography risks legibility issues and eye fatigue during extended sessions. The card-based control sections give good structure, yet the overall hierarchy could be tightened so that the most-used actions stand out faster.

## Visual Hierarchy
- The header and preview section sit on similarly dark backgrounds, reducing contrast between primary navigation and status information. Consider lightening the preview container or adding a subtle border/separator so the header does not blend into the body.
- Button labels use 9–10px font sizes (`.control-btn`), which will be difficult on a physical touch panel where the user stands farther away. Bumping this to at least 12–14px would improve readability.
- Icons inside the buttons are helpful, but the current ordering (label before icon) and varying left margins make alignment feel inconsistent. Aligning the icon above or to the left with consistent spacing will feel calmer.

## Color & Accessibility
- The maroon background (#782F40) with white text meets contrast guidelines, but the gray text on white cards (`color: #782F40` with small fonts) needs larger sizes to remain AA compliant.
- Alerts are handled via browser dialogs; for a kiosk-style UI, inline banners or toast messages would feel more polished and keep the user immersed in the branded experience.

## Interaction Patterns
- The preview screens gain a green glow when active, which is a nice affordance. However, when blanked the text flips to “Blanked” yet keeps the same dark gradient background. Consider a neutral “screen off” treatment (e.g., flat charcoal) to reinforce state change.
- Power controls use green for on and red for off, but the rest of the interface leans on maroon/gold. Swapping to brand colors (e.g., garnet/gold) would keep the palette cohesive.

## Responsiveness
- The layout adapts at 1200px and 992px breakpoints, but the grid still tries to maintain six columns. Below tablet width, the cards become cramped. Introducing an additional breakpoint that collapses controls into two columns (or a single column stack) would improve usability on smaller devices or reduced-width kiosks.

## Suggestions Summary
1. Increase base font sizes on buttons and labels for readability.
2. Introduce clearer separation between header, preview, and control sections.
3. Normalize icon placement and spacing within buttons.
4. Replace browser alerts with branded inline notifications.
5. Add a responsive breakpoint around 768px to stack control sections more comfortably.

These adjustments should retain the polished feel while improving clarity and usability for instructors in classroom settings.
